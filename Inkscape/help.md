Inkscape’s Python extensions



```
pip install inkex


If that fails, use:
pip install git+https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkex.git



```


Check
```
python3 -c "import inkex; print('OK')"


```





If you want your script to run as an Inkscape extension, it must be placed in:

```
~/.config/inkscape/extensions/

```
